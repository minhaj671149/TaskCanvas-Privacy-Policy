        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Effective Date: 18/10/2024</p>

        <p>Thank you for using TaskCanvas. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose your information when you use our app. By using the app, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect minimal information in order to provide you with a smooth and efficient experience while using our app. The following outlines what is collected:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Storage Data:</strong> The app uses your device's local storage to save tasks you create, such as the task title, description, color coding, and scheduling options. This data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to any server.</li>
            <li><strong>Pomodoro Timer Settings:</strong> Custom timer settings you adjust are stored locally on your device. This information is not shared or transmitted elsewhere.</li>
            <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> If you grant permission, the app will send notifications to your device regarding task reminders or Pomodoro timer completions. These notifications are generated locally and do not involve any collection of personal data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not collect any personal information like your name, email, phone number, or location data unless explicitly required by future features, and we will notify you of any changes to this policy if such collection becomes necessary.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The information stored in local storage is used exclusively to support the functionality of the app, specifically for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To create, display, and manage your tasks.</li>
            <li>To store your preferred Pomodoro timer settings.</li>
            <li>To send task and timer notifications to help manage your productivity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not access, share, or transmit this information to any third parties or external servers.</p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>This app does not use third-party services that could collect your data. All of your information stays within the app and your device’s local storage.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>All task data and timer settings are stored locally on your device. You have full control over this data and can delete it at any time by clearing the app's local storage through your device's settings.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Deleting Data:</strong> If you choose to uninstall the app or clear the app’s data from your device, all stored information, including tasks and custom settings, will be permanently deleted.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Notification Permissions</h2>
        <p>If you choose to enable notifications (for the Pomodoro timer), the app will request your permission to send notifications. You can manage this permission from your device’s settings at any time.</p>

        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the local data stored on your device from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no method of electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p>

        <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>This app is not directed at individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it immediately.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised policy within the app or on our website. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any updates. If there are any material changes, we will notify you through the app or other appropriate means.</p>

        <h2>9. Your Consent</h2>
        <p>By using this app, you consent to our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the app or disable notifications in your device settings.</p>
